# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets based on their sentiment using Python, scikit-learn, and NLP techniques.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Lowercasing**: Converted all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
- **Removing Numbers**: Removed numerical values as they do not contribute to sentiment analysis.
- **Removing Punctuation**: Stripped punctuation to focus on the words.
- **Stopword Removal**: Removed common English stopwords to reduce noise in the data.

### 2. Feature Extraction

- Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization to convert the cleaned text data into numerical features that can be used for model training.

### 3. Model Training

- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier on the vectorized text data to predict the sentiment of tweets. The model was trained to classify sentiments into categories such as Positive, Neutral, and Negative.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and a classification report. The evaluation metrics provided insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Results Visualization

- Visualized the confusion matrix using a heatmap to better understand the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Files

- `train_data.csv`: Contains the training data with tweets and their corresponding sentiments.
- `validation_data.csv`: Contains the validation data used to test the model.
- `validation_results.csv`: Contains the validation data with the predicted sentiments from the model.
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: Python script that includes the code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
    ```

2. **Download NLTK Stopwords**: Make sure to download the NLTK stopwords by running the following in your Python environment:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the `sentiment_analysis.py` script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```

4. **View Results**: Check the `validation_results.csv` file for the predicted sentiments and view the confusion matrix heatmap generated by the script.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, enhancing skills in text analysis and predictive modeling. It deepened the understanding of sentiment analysis and reinforced the ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured data.
